# Hong-Kong-Stock-Market-Dataset


The prediction performance and error rate still face limitations due to the lack of correlational analysis between STI and stock movement. Our paper proposes a correlational strategy to overcome these challenges by analyzing the correlation of STI with stock movement using neural networks with the feature vector.
